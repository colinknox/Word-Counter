# Word Counter

## Why Was This Built?
```
I've been practicing how to use dictionaries by creating programs.
After prompting Claude on some starter projects to work on, this 
word counter was the first suggested.
```

## What Does the Word Counter Do?
```
As the name states, it counts words. You're asked by the program to
type in a sentence. After doing so, it will count every time a word
appears. For example, if you type "Red roof, green roof", it will 
output that "roof" appeared 2 times, "Red" 1 time, and "green" 1
time.
